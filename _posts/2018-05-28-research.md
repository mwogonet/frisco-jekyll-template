We trained a machine learning algorithm on various classes such as Cassava Mosaic Disease, Cassava Bacterial Blight, Cassava Brown Streak Disease, Cassava Green Mite and Healthy images. The steps performed during this process include the following;

Step one: We defined the structure of our files. These image files were stored in the ../Severity_final and ../Severity_cropped folders. Within these folders, we had a folder for each disease and healthy images. Within the different disease folders, we had the severities for each disease.

Step two: We made different partitions of files which were included in the label dictionary. The label_dictionary is an object where the keys are the different disease labels and the values are the list of directories.

Step three: Compilation.This was done before training the model. We had to configure the learning process which was done via the compile method.It receives three arguments such as the optimizer, the loss function and the list of metrics.

Step four:Start training.For trainining, we used the fit function.The arguments within this function included;                            epochs,steps_per_epoch,class_weight,validation_data,validation_steps,callbacks.



During the training process, we made a comparison between both the cropped images and uncropped images to find out which produced a better validation accuracy.
We trained on 1474 healthy images and 3018 images infected with cassava mosaic disease.




The Agricultural experts identified the common diseases that affect the cassava leaves which included cassava mosaic disease, cassava brown streak disease, cassava bacterial blight and cassava green mite disease. We obtained information about the cassava diseases, their symptoms, how they affect cassava growth, their causes, and how they can be controlled. The table below shows a summary of the results about the diseases from the interview.	

| Disease       | Causes        |Symptoms| Control Mechanism |
|:------------------|:-------------|:------|:------------------|
|Cassava Mosaic     | Virus, spread by the whitefly vector| Wrinkling and yellowing of leaves | use of resistant varieties |
| Cassava Brown Streak    | Brown Streak Virus, spread by the Whitefly|Yellowish dots along leafâ€™s veins |Breed resistant varieties|
| Cassava Bacterial Blight  | Bacteria, pathogens in the air, enter injured eg afer a storm|Wilting of the leaf right from the apex |No much research has been done on this disease|



## Professional Profile Summary
![alt text](https://mwogonet.github.io/images/participants.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Respondents were asked about their different professions. It is important for us to know the segments of potential users and how they might use our research. The breakdown consisted of 65% farmers and 35% agricultural experts.

## Types of cassava Grown
The respondents chose the crops they specialized in from a list of crops that we provided them with. The results were as follows; Cassava (94.4%), Potatoes (44.4%), Legumes (44.4%), Maize (5.6%), Cabbages (5.6%), Yams (5.6%), Bananas (5.6%).

## Would they pay for an automated diagnosis tool?
Of the people we interviewed, 83.3% were positive towards the automatic based technique solution and would be willing to pay for it unlike 16.7% who would not pay for the tool because they prefer using naked eyes.

## Devices preferred for leaf Diagnosis
88.9% of the respondents would be comfortable using mobile phones to perform leaf disease diagnosis, 27.8% would find it convenient to use tablets. The responses are shown in the figure below;

## Conclusion

Our initial research survey discovered that farmers and researchers alike are positive towards the use of an automated approach for diagnosis of cassava diseases. it also taught us that local farmers in Uganda have limited knowledge concerning the different diseases affecting their cassava crops and possible control measures.
It's from this survey that we shall start building the foundations of MwogoNet.
