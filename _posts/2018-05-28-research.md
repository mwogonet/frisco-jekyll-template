We trained a machine learning algorithm on various classes such as Cassava Mosaic Disease, Cassava Bacterial Blight, Cassava Brown Streak Disease, Cassava Green Mite and Healthy images. The steps performed during this process include the following;

Step one: We defined the structure of our files. These image files were stored in the cropped and uncropped folders. Within these folders, we had a folder for each disease and healthy images. Within the different disease folders, we had the severities for each disease.

Step two: We made different partitions of files which were included in the label dictionary. The label_dictionary is an object where the keys are the different disease labels and the values are the list of directories.

Step three: Compilation.This was done before training the model. We had to configure the learning process which was done via the compile method.It receives three arguments such as the optimizer, the loss function and the list of metrics.

Step four:Start training.For training, we used the fit function.The arguments within this function included;                            epochs,steps_per_epoch,class_weight,validation_data,validation_steps,callbacks.


During the training process, we made a comparison between both the cropped images and uncropped images to find out which produced a better validation accuracy.
We trained on 1474 healthy images and 3018 images infected with cassava mosaic disease.
