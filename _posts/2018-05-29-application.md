After the training process, a Keras inference graph was generated indicating the predictions made by the model. This graph was then saved and frozen as a <b>".pb"</b> graph thereby changing the graph to a <b>Tensorflow graph</b> which can be interpreted by Android Studio.<br/> 
The MwogoNet application currently runs on an Android operating system and has been tested on Android version 7.<br/>
The Interfaces for the application are explained below;
